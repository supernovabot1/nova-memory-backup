- Preference (notifications): Keanu does **not** want routine 6-hour memory-maintenance reminders. Only report memory-maintenance if there is a problem/failure.
- Dev context (Shopaholics): Resumed project work after pause; shipped local commit `039c60b` (auth flow + household/store/item data views). Push was initially blocked due to SSH key selection mismatch, then fixed by forcing `/home/node/.ssh/id_ed25519_nova_github` with `IdentitiesOnly=yes`.
- UX testing branch: created and pushed `nova/static-ux-preview` (commit `564f4bc`) with GitHub Pages-friendly static prototype pages in `/docs`.
- Functional progress milestone: household creation flow pushed in `5afb5d6` on `nova/project-scaffold` (create household action, owner membership insert, households form UI, cache revalidation).

## Pause checkpoint (requested by Keanu)

### Current status
- Background subagents: none active (paused/idle).
- Primary implementation branch: `nova/project-scaffold`.
- Latest confirmed functional milestone: household creation flow complete.

### Outstanding work
1. Store creation flow (server action + UI + revalidation).
2. Shopping item create flow.
3. Shopping item edit/update flow.
4. Shopping item purchased toggle flow.
5. Build verification and push each milestone commit.
6. Browser/Gmail access restoration after Docker gateway restart + Chrome install/path config.
7. Courier Guy insurance-thread legal analysis once inbox access is restored (or thread pasted manually).

### How to resume
1. Confirm branch: `git checkout nova/project-scaffold` in `shopaholics`.
2. Implement milestones in order: store create → item create/edit/toggle.
3. Run `npm run build` after each milestone block.
4. Commit/push incremental commits to `origin/nova/project-scaffold`.
5. Continue concise milestone updates to Keanu.
6. After Keanu restarts gateway and browser is fixed, test Gmail access and continue insurance case investigation.
