## Setup Day

- First boot. Met Keanu.
- Name: Nova ☀️ | Vibe: casual & direct | Timezone: GMT+2
- Installed agent-browser (headless Chromium CLI from vercel-labs)
- Logged into Google account: supernova.bot.1@gmail.com (Nova Maharaj)
- OpenClaw sandbox browser config added but gateway token mismatch — using agent-browser as workaround
- Keanu has Brave API creds to share + more setup planned
- Preference from Keanu: for long browser automation tasks, use a Sonnet sub-agent to reduce cost and avoid blocking/freezing main thread.
- Reinforced preference: run all browser-based tasks as Sonnet sub-agents to prevent main session blocking.
- Keanu preference: whenever running scripts or heavier tasks, use a Spark sub-agent by default.
- Execution policy from Keanu:
  - Main (opus/thinking models): planning, debugging, orchestration only.
  - Default execution workers: Spark sub-agents for scripts/tasks.
  - On Spark failure: retry via Sonnet sub-agent, then main orchestrates completion.
  - Priority: never block main process during task execution.

## Major setup outcomes

- Gateway auth mismatch resolved after token source correction.
- Installed Foundry toolchain (forge/anvil/cast) in container.
- Created Docker-less dev script for horsesrawesome: `scripts/dev-no-envio.sh`.
- Ran local stack (no Envio): contracts compile/deploy + seed succeeded; frontend deps installed; vite startup reached.
- Created and shared Google Calendar `Nova + Keanu` with Keanu.
- Telegram profile image variants generated and sent.
- GitHub access configured with SSH key auth for Nova account; collaborator invite flow tested.
- Created repo `supernovabot1/nova-hello-world`, added `hello.py`, invited `@keanumaharaj`, and changed repo visibility to private.

## Security / hygiene decisions

- Do not pass credentials in chat going forward.
- Rotate Google password (exposed earlier in chat).
- Migrate Brave API key, gateway token, and Telegram bot token to Docker secrets.
- Remove raw gateway/token values from `openclaw.json` and load from runtime secrets.
- New policy: maintain off-host memory backup in GitHub repo `nova-memory-backup` and commit+push MEMORY.md + memory/ every 6 hours.

## Infra/config state (latest)

- Docker secrets migration prepared for: `brave_api_key`, `openclaw_gateway_token`, `telegram_bot_token`.
- Compose structure clarified: one `secrets:` block under service + one top-level `secrets:` definitions block.
- `command` must stay under the service level (not top-level).
- Backup automation live:
  - Script: `scripts/push-memory-backup.sh`
  - Cron: every 6 hours at 00:00/06:00/12:00/18:00 (Africa/Johannesburg).
- Context-maintenance cron also set to run every 6 hours.
